  // is this correct? do not show me the code if i got it wrong only give me the english corrections. do not give me the correct answer in english or in code. guide me in english to think about what the right answer might be. if something is not lined out a a constraint then dont therorize if it is. if a later step is impacted by a step i did incorrectly earlier in the code do not mention the later step until the issue that is impacting it is fixed. do not give me the answer, guide me to think about what the correct answer could be.
