the plan....


refocus on basics- code without the AI bot



how.....
do neetcode questions, 1-2 a day

pseudo code the answer to the question, then ask the AI "

I am pseudo coding the answer to this quesiton. do not give me any code suggestions. is this psuedo code ont he right track? I want to understand if my thinking is right before coding it. Do not give me alternate approaches. do give me simple reasons why it might be wrong if it is wrong. do not give me a better aprroach. do not give me hints. I want to know if my thinking is correct and if not tell me no and simply tell me why without suggesting way

"

once psuedo coding is correct, then code the question
